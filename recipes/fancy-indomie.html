    <p>When I made this recipe, I had some veggies that were going to go bad soon. I was hungry and needed to do something with them, so I just added it to my indomie. Best thing I did but simultaneously worst because of the cleaning up I had to do after. Now, you try it!</p>

    <h3>STEPS:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, slice everything as thinly as possible. Except your garlic, you need to mince it until it's smooth like paste or something.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Secondly, you heat up your pan (make sure it's a deep one 'cause you're going to boil your indomie in there too) and melt some butter. You can heat up your sesame oil or use veggie oil, whatever you like. Fry a bit of the green onion (this one is chopped) and add your sliced zucchini. Fry them until it's somehow brown before adding le onions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Now, add you're onions and let it fry until it's become nice and all then add your garlic and fry that for a lil' bit, maybe like turning the spoon or cooking utensil 7 times, then add your carrots. Fry that until it becomes all limp and the color has somehow turned a bit yellower in a strange way.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then, add your cabbage and fry again until its soul has been taken away. Then add your tomato paste and fry some more. Here, you add a lil' bit of vinegar, pinch of sugar, black pepper and chilli flakes. Once you fried it for a bit longer, add your water and allow it to boil. Let the veggies boil too for a few minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Here, you add your indomie pack together with the seasonings. Once it's almost done, crack and egg and cover the pan so it can cook from up. However you like your egg done (I like mine runny) you turn off the fire and remove the lid. Be careful, you can overcook your egg if you not careful. Then, sprinkle your leftover green onions which its only purpose is for making the indomie look sexy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Finally, you get to enjoy it, human.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>EXTRA TIPS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you like your eggs sunny fried or scrambled, then do that.</li>
        <li>If you like any other protein like chicken or meat, add it after you fry the onions and garlic in the third step.</li>
        <li>If you want to eat plain old indomie, then why are you here? (༎ຶꈊ༎ຶ╬)</li>
