    <p>I made this as a sleepless child. I guess I was just born with talent.( ◡‿◡ *)</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
    <p>Here is what you'll need (measure with however much sandwich you desire to consume):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sliced bread</li>
        <li>Sliced mortadella (please, do not use it as a whole block unless you a beast)</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Sliced Kashkaval cheese (you can use any kind of cheese you want)</li>
        <li>Ketchup (optinal)</li>
        <li>Onions (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was a child, do not judge until you try it.</p>

    <h3>STEPS:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread mayo on both bread. If you want ketchup, then spread ketchup on one bread and mayo on the other.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then, add your mortadella, lettuce, mustard, cheese and onions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Close your sandwich and toast it. (or grill it, or eat it soft, idk, but the cheese gotta melt.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Now, bite into perfection.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>EXTRA TIPS:</h3>
    <p>Now as a grownup, I would've done just a few things differently:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grill or fry your mortadella until it forms that brown crust thing.</li>
        <li>Wash your veggies (thankfully the lettuce I used as a child was washed... or was it?)</li>
        <li>Add chilli. Anything spicy makes everything taste better. Unless you don't enjoy pain.</li> 
    </ul>
